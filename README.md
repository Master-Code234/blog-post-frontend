# Approach taken:

In this project I developed a full-stack blog post website that allows users to write, post, delete and edit blog posts on the website.
My approach to creating this project was to first plan out my website by creating a blueprint of how I wanted the final UI and site to look.
Creating a blueprint of my website first helped me to visualize the basic structure and core functionality of the website. My first step in
creating this project was setting up all the essential backend code and connecting to the mongoDB database. Then I designed and implemented a 
schema that defined the structure of blog posts. With that in place I then began to code the frontend of the website. I Connected my frontend code 
to my backend code using axios. Then I  broke my UI down into separate pages and began coding the content for each page. Once I completed the core 
functionality of the website I began applying CSS to the project. To help ensure an organized and maintainable website code structure I created a separate
CSS styles folder and created a new CSS file for each page.
