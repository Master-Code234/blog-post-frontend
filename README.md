# Approach taken:

In this project I developed a full-stack blog post website that allows users to write, post, delete and edit blog posts on the website.
My approach to creating this project was to first plan out my website by creating a blueprint of how I wanted the final UI and site to look.
Creating a blueprint of my website first helped me to visualize the basic structure and core functionality of the website. Then I broke my UI 
down into separate pages.
