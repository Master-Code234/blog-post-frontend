# Approach taken:

In this project I developed a full-stack blog post website that allows users to write, post, delete and edit blog posts on the website.
My approach to creating this project was to first plan out my website by creating a blueprint of how I wanted the final UI and site to look.
Creating a blueprint of my website first helped me to visualize the basic structure and core functionality of the website. Then I broke my UI 
down into separate pages and began coding the content for each page. Once I completed the core functionality of the website I began applying 
CSS to the project. To help ensure an organized and maintainable website code structure I created a separate CSS styles folder and created a new 
CSS file for each page.
